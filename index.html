            A record of my personal journey throughout the culinary world, as well as a first personal project for web development. Expect either a dead page that never gets hosted or something that may actually be turned into a self-updating website! Plans include actual pages, as well as the ability for the website to dynamically display “cards”, or blocks of text for each time I actually make a recipe. Actual website visual design is also in the works.
        </p>
        <p>If I were to list out the features I plan to potentially add, then:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiple pages</li>
            <li>Sidebar or top menu bar for navigation</li>
            <li>A complete mockup for a "base" recipe page</li>
            <li>Database integration</li>
            <li>Ability for users to add their own creations/recipes/modifications/feedback as cards, including details such as difficulty, time taken, pictures, substitutes, etc.</li>
            <li>Ability for users to rate others' cards</li>
            <li>Some algorithm to sort based on ratings</li>
            <li>Tags system to organize user cards</li>
            <li>Algorithm to detect or recommend relevant tags to a user's card</li>
            <li>Link recipes from other sources as their own cards</li>
        </ul>
